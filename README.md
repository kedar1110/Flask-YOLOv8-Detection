# Flask-YOLOv8-Detection
A full-stack web application that uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection in images, videos, and webcam streams. Supports switching between default pretrained YOLOv8 and custom-trained models

Flask YOLOv8 Object Detection System

This project is a web-based application built with Flask and YOLOv8 for object detection. It allows users to:

  >"Upload images or videos and receive annotated detection results".
>
  >"Use their computer webcam for live, real-time object detection streaming to the browser".
 
  >"Choose between the default YOLOv8n model and a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for specialized object categories (e.g.spectacles)".

The system uses Ultralytics' YOLOv8 for powerful, accurate detection and OpenCV for image and video processing. The web interface is clean, user-friendly, and responsive, making it easy to demonstrate computer vision capabilities in real-world scenarios.
